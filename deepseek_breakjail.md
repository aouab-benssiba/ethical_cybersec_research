- in this case, we try to extract two types of consoles one is breakjail, the other one is restricted.
  ## as shown below the breakjail exploit and the chat response

this makes this AI model capable of generating or debugging any type of script, which is extremely dangerous !!

## Conclusion:
- this is the same Chat-GPT vuln, which has been replicated as well to this DeepSeek AI module that is deployed on their website: https://chat.deepseek.com
